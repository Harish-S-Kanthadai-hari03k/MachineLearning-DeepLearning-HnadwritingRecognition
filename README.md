# Ink Intelligence: Building a Robust Handwriting Recognition System using Deep Learning
Innovative and effective framework for correctly identifying and categorizing handwritten numbers and text

# Problem Statement
The problem of accurately recognizing and digitizing handwritten digits and text remains a challenging task in the field of machine learning. Despite recent advancements in deep learning and computer vision, existing models still struggle to accurately identify and classify diverse handwriting styles, sizes, and orientations. This poses significant limitations in various real-world applications, such as document digitization, handwriting analysis, and postal automation. Thus, there is a need to develop more efficient and robust machine learning algorithms that can accurately recognize and classify handwritten digits and text, and can adapt to diverse writing styles and variations.

# Objective
This project's goal is to create an innovative and effective framework for correctly identifying and categorizing handwritten numbers and text that can adjust to different handwriting sizes, styles, and orientations. The suggested framework will make use of powerful machine learning models to categorize and digitize the handwritten information and deep learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to extract pertinent features and patterns from the input photos. By extensive experiments and benchmarks, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework will be assessed and compared to current state-of-the-art techniques for handwritten digit and text recognition. The overarching objective of this project is to promote machine learning research and to enable more efficient and dependable automation of numerous real-world applications that rely on precise digitization of handwritten text.

# About
Works by incorporating the IAM Dataset, which includes ground-truth targets of variable lengths.

Each entry in this dataset consists of an image containing handwritten text, with the corresponding target being the text within the image. The IAM dataset is a widely accepted benchmark for evaluating OCR (Optical Character Recognition) systems.

Handwriting recognition involves the conversion of handwritten text into machine-readable format. This technology finds applications in various domains, such as document scanning, handwritten note recognition, and the processing of handwritten forms. These applications encompass tasks like document digitization, handwriting analysis, and automated grading of examinations. An effective approach to tackle handwriting recognition employs a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function.
