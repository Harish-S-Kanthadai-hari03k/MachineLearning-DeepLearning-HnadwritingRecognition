# MachineLearning-DeepLearning-HnadwritingRecognition
Innovative and effective framework for correctly identifying and categorizing handwritten numbers and text
# About
Works by uincorporating the IAM Dataset, which includes ground-truth targets of variable lengths.

Each entry in this dataset consists of an image containing handwritten text, with the corresponding target being the text within the image. The IAM dataset is a widely accepted benchmark for evaluating OCR (Optical Character Recognition) systems.

Handwriting recognition involves the conversion of handwritten text into machine-readable format. This technology finds applications in various domains, such as document scanning, handwritten note recognition, and the processing of handwritten forms. These applications encompass tasks like document digitization, handwriting analysis, and automated grading of examinations. An effective approach to tackle handwriting recognition employs a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function.
